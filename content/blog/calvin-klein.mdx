Today, we're excited to launch the [Dub Help Center](/help) – a one-stop shop for all your Dub-related questions.

Ever since we launched Dub, we've been receiving a lot of questions from our users via channels like [Crisp](https://crisp.chat/), Email, Twitter, etc. Over time, we noticed a pattern – _many of the questions were repeated_.

So we decided to build a Help Center to help our users find answers to their questions – without having to wait for us to reply.
