Today, we're excited to launch the [Dub Help Center](/help) – a one-stop shop for all your Dub-related questions.

Ever since we launched Dub, we've been receiving a lot of questions from our users via channels like [Crisp](https://crisp.chat/), Email, Twitter, etc. Over time, we noticed a pattern – _many of the questions were repeated_.

So we decided to build a Help Center to help our users find answers to their questions – without having to wait for us to reply.

## What's in the Help Center?

The Help Center is a collection of articles that cover the most common questions we receive from our users. It's a living knowledge base that we'll be updating regularly.

Here are some of the popular articles on the Help Center:


We've also created categories to help you find the articles you're looking for:
