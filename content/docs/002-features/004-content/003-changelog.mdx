A changelog is a documented record that tracks updates and modifications made to a software product over time. It serves several crucial purposes:  

* Historical Log: It maintains a historical record of changes, providing insight into the software's evolution.

* Transparency: It promotes transparency by keeping users informed about changes, bug fixes, new features, and improvements.

* Communication Channel: It acts as a communication channel between software companies and users, aiding in version management, user education, bug tracking, and feedback collection.

Ultimately, a changelog fosters trust and user engagement while showcasing the ongoing evolution of the software.
