In this guide, you will learn how to create a new project, deploy a MongoDB cluster on MongoDB Atlas, set up a local database for your development environment, and configure network access for your project. Additionally, you will set up your connection string for local development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A MongoDB Atlas account (if you don't have one, you can create it at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
- Node.js installed on your local machine (https://nodejs.org/).

## Create a New Project on MongoDB Atlas

1. Log in to your MongoDB Atlas account.
1. From the MongoDB Atlas dashboard, click "Create a New Project."
1. Give your project a meaningful name and click "Next."

## Deploy a MongoDB Cluster

1. Inside your new project, click on "Clusters" in the left-hand navigation panel.
1. Click the "Build a Cluster" button.
1. Follow the setup wizard to configure your cluster, including selecting a cloud provider, region, and cluster configuration.
1. Click "Create Cluster" to start the deployment. This process might take a few minutes.

## Set Up a Local Database for Development

To work offline and speed up development, you can set up a local database. You can use a tool like MongoDB Compass or run MongoDB locally. Make sure you have MongoDB installed on your local machine.

## Configure Network Access

To allow connections to your MongoDB Atlas cluster, you need to configure network access.

1. In your MongoDB Atlas project, click "Network Access" in the left-hand navigation panel.
1. Click the "+ Add IP Address" button.
1. In the "Access List Entry" field, enter **0.0.0.0/0** This allows connections from any IP address.
1. Click "Confirm" to add this access rule.

## Configure Your Local Development Environment

1. If you haven't already, rename the .env.example file in your project to .env.local.
1. Open the .env.local file and find the DATABASE_URL variable.
1. Replace the placeholder with the connection string for your MongoDB Atlas cluster. You can find this connection string in your cluster settings on the MongoDB Atlas dashboard.

``` shell

DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@clustername.mongodb.net/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority

```

Replace **username**, **password**, **clustername**, and **database** with your actual credentials and cluster details.
