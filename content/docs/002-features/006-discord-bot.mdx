This bot is helpful to send a log message to a Discord server through a webhook.

## Configuring

1. Create a account in [Discord](https://discord.com/)
2. Create a new [Discord Server](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
3. Open your Server **Settings** and head into the Integrations tab
4. Click the **Create Webhook button** to create a new webhook
5. Copy the webhook url to .env.local 

``` shell

DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

```

* Navigate to the **../src/lib/discord.ts** file and take a look at the **sendLogToDiscord** function.

Usage:
``` js

import { sendLogToDiscord } from "@/lib/discord";

export const importantAction = async ( email:string ) = {

  try {

    await sendImportantEmail({ email });

  } catch (error) {

    await sendLogToDiscord({ 
      channel: "auth",
      event: "magic link",
      icon: "ðŸ”’",
      description: `User with email address ${identifier} cannot receive the magic link.`, 
      type: "error",
      tags:{
        email: identifier
      }
    })

  }

 }

```
