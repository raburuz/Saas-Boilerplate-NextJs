## Runtime Errors

The **../src/app/error.ts** file convention allows you to gracefully handle unexpected runtime errors in nested routes.

## Error 404 Not Found

Error 404 (not found) is handled gracefully in the /app/not-found.js high-level component.

When an error occurs, a beautiful page is displayed, and users can reach out for support through the 
**NotFound.tsx** component. 

* To customize the code, navigate to the **../src/boilerplate/shared/pages/NotFound.tsx**.
