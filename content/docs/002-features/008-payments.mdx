6. Fraud & Risk Rules:

## Local Environment (Test Mode)

7. Turn ON Test Mode:

* In your **Stripe Dashboard**, locate the **test/production switch** and **turn ON the Test Mode**.

8. Create a New Product and Copy Price ID:

* In your **Stripe Dashboard**, navigate to **Products**.
* Create a new product: subscription or payment (one-time).
* Copy the price ID ( e.g., **price_2NclI4X9qpfeQPXGTDyG9aMK** ) and paste it into your **../src/lib/plans/plans.ts** file:

``` js

//SUBSCRIPTIONS
export const planConfig: IPlan = {
  mode : "subscription",
  plans: [
    {
      key: SubscriptionPlanKey.pro,
      name: "Pro",
      description:"For medium-sized business",
      isPopular: true,
      features: [],
      prices: [
        {
          frequency:Frequency.monthly,
          amount: "$9/month",
          priceIds: {
            development: "price_2NclI4X9qpfeQPXGTDyG9aMK",
            production: "",
            test: "",
          },
        },
        {
          frequency:Frequency.yearly,
          amount: "$100/year",
          priceIds: {
            development: "",
            production: "",
            test: "",
          },
        },
      ]
    },
  ]
}

//ONE-TIME PAYMENTS
export const planConfig: IPlan = { 
  mode : "payment",
  plans:[
    {
      key: "pro",
      name: "Pro",
      description: "For individuals",
      amount: "$150 / one-time",
      isPopular: true,
      features: [],
      priceIds: {
        production: "",
        development: "price_2NclI4X9qpfeQPXGTDyG9aMK",
        test: "",
      }
    }
  ]
}

```

9. Obtain API Keys:
* In your **Stripe Dashboard**, go to **Developers**.
* Copy your public and private keys.
* Add these keys to your project's environment variables as **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY** and **STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY** in your development environment (e.g., .env.local).

``` shell

STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_xxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_xxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

```

10. Set Up Webhooks Locally:

* In your **Stripe Dashboard**, navigate to **Developers**.
* Click on **Webhooks**.
* Follow the steps to set up webhook events for **test in a local development**.
* After logging into [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli), use the following command to forward webhook events to your local API

``` js

stripe login

// Forward events to your local development server
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhook

```

* Copy the **STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET** to your .env.local

``` shell

STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

```

## Going to Production:

11. Turn OFF Test Mode:

* In your **Stripe Dashboard**, **turn OFF Test Mode** when you are ready to go live.

12. Configure API Keys for Production:

* In your **Stripe Dashboard**, go to **Developers**.
* Copy your **public and private keys for the production environment**.
* Add these keys to your production environment variables as **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY** and **STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY**.

13. Set Up Webhooks for Production:

* In your **Stripe Dashboard**, navigate to **Developers**, then **Webhooks**.
* Add an endpoint with your production domain and **/api/stripe/webhook**.

``` shell

https://your_domain.com/api/stripe/webhook

```

* Select the necessary events: 

``` shell

customer.subscription.updated

customer.subscription.deleted

```

* Copy the signing secret and add it to your production environment variables as **STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET**.

Optional: Configure Payout Schedule:

* In your **Stripe Dashboard**, go to **Balance**.
* Choose **Manage Payouts**.
* Set a specific date of the month to receive your payouts.

## Webhook 

### Listen for new events

1. Navigate to the **..src/lib/stripe/events.ts** file to customize your code or take a look at the webhook.
2. Add your **subscriptions OR one-time** events to the array

``` js

// SUBSCRIPTIONS
export const stripeSubscriptionEvents: Stripe.Event.Type[] = [
  'customer.subscription.created',
  //The subscription was created -> Create Record (Previously created, when the user login first time)
  'customer.subscription.updated',
  //The subscription was downgraded/upgraded -> Provisional Access and Updated Record
  'customer.subscription.deleted',
  //The subscription was canceled -> Revoke access and set to "free"
  'invoice.payment_failed',
  //The user payment failed -> Revoke access and send email to user (optional) to pay/update payment method
  //Sent each billing interval if there is an issue with your customer’s payment method.
  'invoice.paid',
  //The user payment was made -> Provisional access 
  //Sent each billing interval when a payment succeeds.
  'checkout.session.completed',
  //The user paid successfully and the subscription was created -> Provisional Access
  //Sent when a customer clicks the Pay or Subscribe button in Checkout, informing you of a new purchase
]

// ONE-TIME PAYMENTS
export const oneTimePaymentEvents: Stripe.Event.Type[] = [
  "charge.succeeded",
  //Help to capture the receipt_url 
  //By default billing portal don't show one-time invoices 
  "payment_intent.succeeded",
  // The payment intend was made succeeded -> Provisional Access and Update Record
  // It will get fired and at the very next second the checkout.session.completed will get fired
  "payment_intent.payment_failed",
  // A payment failed, to notify the customer that their payment has failed. -> Revoke access if exist
  'checkout.session.completed',
  //The user paid successfully and the subscription was created -> Provisional Access
  //The event won't be emitted if a user's payment fails, or if they fail to provide any of the required fields.
]
```

3. Navigate to the **..src/lib/stripe/webhook.ts** file and add your own business logic to the webhook

``` js

const subscriptionActions = async ( { event } : { event: IStripe.Event } ) => {

  // Rest of code 

  if(event.type === "new.event") {
  
  // Add your own business logic

  }

  // Rest of code

}

const oneTimePaymentActions = async ( { event } : { event: IStripe.Event } ) => {

  // Rest of code 

  if(event.type === "new.event") {
  
  // Add your own business logic

  }

  // Rest of code

}

```
