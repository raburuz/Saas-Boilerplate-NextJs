Founder utilizes [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for users authentication. To configure these services, follow these steps:

* You can configure it in the **../src/lib/auth** file, make the necessary adjustments if needed.

1. Set your environment variables in the .env.local file as follows:

``` shell

NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_ramdom_secret_key

```

## Create a new project on Google Cloud:

1. Log in to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to **APIs and Services** and then **Credentials**
1. In the **Credentials** tab, click the **+ Create Credentials** button, then select **OAuth client ID**


## Configure Google OAuth Client ID:

1. Choose "Web Application" as the application type.
1. Add the following to the "Authorized JavaScript origins" section:
    * For development (localhost), add **http://localhost:3000**
    * For your production site, add **https://your_site.com**
1. In the "Authorized redirect URIs" section, add the following:
    * For development (localhost), add **http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google**
    * For your production site, add **https://your_site.com/api/auth/callback/google**
1. Click the **Create** button to generate your OAuth client ID and Client Secret.

## Save Credentials in .env.local

1. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret generated in the previous step.
1. Paste the Client ID into the GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID variable and the Client Secret into the GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET variable in your .env.local file

``` shell

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

```

## Configure Google OAuth Consent Screen

1. Click on the **Configure Consent Screen** button.
2. Fill in the required information for your OAuth consent screen. 
3. Add **userinfo.email** and **userinfo.profile** to the **Scopes** section.
4. Add yourself as a test user under the **Test users** section.
5. Click **Save** to save your consent screen configuration.
6. Click the **Publish App** button and submit your consent screen for verification.


## Google Verification Process:

Google will email you with further instructions regarding the verification process.
During this process, **you'll need to have your domain verified with Google Search Console**


You can already use Google login on localhost.
On your production site, Google login will work, but you may see a warning until you complete the verification process, which can take a few days.


Please note that the **PrismaAdapter** saves new users in the database when they click log in with Google button. Ensure that you have configured the database before using this functionality.
