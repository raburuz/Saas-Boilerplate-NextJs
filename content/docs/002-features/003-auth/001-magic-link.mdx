Founder utilizes [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) for users authentication and [Resend](https://resend.com) for sending emails. To configure these services, follow these steps:

* You can configure it in the **../src/lib/auth** file, make the necessary adjustments if needed.

1. Set your environment variables in the .env.local file as follows:

``` shell

RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_ramdom_secret_key

```

2. Navigate to the **/src/config/application** file and modify the **config.resend.from_no_reply** (this will be used **during production**) with the following code:

``` js

export const config = {
  // rest of code
  resend: {
    //rest of code
    from_no_reply: "your_app_name <noreply@your_domain.com>",
  },
}

```

3. **During development**, emails will not be received. Instead, your terminal will display the login code for accessing the application.

Please note that the **PrismaAdapter** saves new users in the database when they click the login link received via email. Ensure that you have configured the database before using this functionality.
