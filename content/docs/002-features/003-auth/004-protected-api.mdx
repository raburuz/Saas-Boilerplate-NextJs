* Compatible with Server Actions

To verify if a user is authenticated, you have several options, including the use of:

* [Next Auth Session](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client)
* Boilerplate (withAuthentication function)

## Next Auth Session

NextAuth.js handles the authentication process automatically. You can make a standard API call on the front-end like this:

``` js

// Front-end
const response = await fetch('/api/some-endpoint');
const data = await response.json();

```

In the backend, you can retrieve the user's session and access the user's data from the database. Make sure to configure your database first.
Your API file might look like this:

``` js

//api/some-endpoint

/* NEXT */
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

/* LIBRARIES */
import { getServerSession } from "next-auth/next";

/* BOILERPLATE */
import { nextAuthOptions } from "@/lib/auth";

/* FUNCTION */
export async function POST( request: Request ) {

  const session = await getServerSession(nextAuthOptions);

  if ( session ) { 
    // Code Logic
  } else {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Not authenticated" }, { status: 401 });
  }

}

```

## Boilerplate (authentication function)

The **authentication function** is a powerful utility that enhances the Next Auth Session with additional options. It serves as a middleware function designed to verify user authentication and authorization roles, particularly for protected API routes.

Here's an example of how to use the authentication function in your code:
``` js

/* NEXT */
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

/* BOILERPLATE */
import { authentication } from "@/lib/auth"

/* FUNCTION */
export async function POST( request: Request ){

  const auth = await authentication({ allow: {  roles : [ "customer" ], subscriptions:["pro"], oneTime: ["pro"] } });
  
  if ( auth.user ) {
    // Code Logic
  } else {
    return NextResponse.json(auth.message, { status: auth.statusCode });
  }
  
}

```

Navigate to the **../src/lib/auth/auth** file and take a look at the **authentication function**. If you need to review the code, you can examine it there.

Good to know: Can be use with server actions :)
