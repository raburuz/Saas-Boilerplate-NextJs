Navigate to the **scr/boilerplate/boilerplate/pages/Onboarding.tsx** file and take a look at the file.

* Feel free to customize the code if needed

``` js

//app router page
 
/* BOILERPLATE */
import { OnboardingPage } from "@/boilerplate/onboarding";
 
export default function Page() {
  return (
    <>
      <OnboardingPage/>
    </>
  )
}

```


The Onboarding Page Component has an available server action. When the user clicks "Go to Dashboard" to finish the onboarding process, 
the isOnboardingComplete property will be checked as "true" in the database and the user will be 
redirected to the user dashboard automatically. 

*Feel free to modify this server action if needed!*

Note: Once isOnboardingComplete is set to true, The user will not be able to return to the onboarding page again.

``` js

/* The property isOnboardingComplete will be marked as true in the database */
isOnboardingComplete: true

```
