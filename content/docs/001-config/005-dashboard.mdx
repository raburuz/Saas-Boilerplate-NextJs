  }
}

```

Here, you can configure the display of links to users based on their roles, as well as the alerts they can receive


## Links

You can display of links on the dashboard is based on the user role.

By instance: 

``` js


  links: { 
    // Customer role links: 
    customer : {
      menu : [
        {
          text: "Home",
          href: "/",
          icon: <Home className="w-4 text-foreground/70"/>,
        },
        // rest of the links here
      ],
      submenu: [
        // your submenu links here
      ]
    },
    // Admin role links: 
    admin: [
      // admin links
    ]
  }

```
Only the user with determinate role can see the display of link on their dashboard

## Alerts

The **Alerts.tsx** is a component that shows predefined information when a user event occurs.

By instance:

``` js

 alerts: {
    queryKey:"alert",
    actions:{
      // Customer role actions: 
      customer:[
        {
          queryValue: "payment_success",
          title: "Payment Successful üéâ",
          description: "You have successfully made your payment.üòÄ",
          variant: "success",
        },
        // rest of events
      ],
      // Admin role actions: 
      admin:[
        // admin events
      ],
    }
  }

```

### Trigger your event! 

The Alerts.tsx component can only be displayed within the Dashboard layout, regardless of the route being displayed.

``` shell

// Show the alert 

http://localhost:3000/settings/billing?alert=payment_success ‚úÖ

http://localhost:3000/dashboard?alert=payment_success ‚úÖ

// Not show the alert 

http://localhost:3000/?alert=payment_success ‚ùå

```
